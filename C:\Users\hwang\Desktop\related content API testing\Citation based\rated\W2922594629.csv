0,1,"Collecting the dead: art, antique and ‘aura’ in personal collections of murderabilia","Murderabilia (murder-memorabilia) has enjoyed increasing tabloid attention over the past two-decades. It follows a sustained appetite for the consumption or more ‘mainstream’ forms of crime and death-based culture, yet has not been explored in a dedicated academic study. Building on work in this journal that has considered dead criminals, the consumption of corpses more generally, or the way that we ‘play’ with death in popular culture – this paper contributes an ethnography of collectors and collections of death, the dead and murder. It explores the idea that the cultural consumption of crime and death is driven by a desire for visceral, gruesome and violent experiences – and proposes that these desires are accessed, in the case of material objects, through consumptive values of antique, aura and authenticity.",antique consumption_(sociology) mainstream dead_body aura ethnography aesthetics popular_culture sociology history criminology art visual_arts media_studies,0,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

1,2,Streaming bloody murder: documentary celebrity and Sophie Toscan Du Plantier anniversary media (SAM),"In 2021, three documentary series revitalised the unsolved murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier in 1996 in West Cork, Ireland, for a global audience of true crime enthusiasts. This article analyses the podcast West Cork (Audible 2018/iTunes 2021) and two streaming series, Murder at the Cottage: The Search for Justice for Sophie (Sky Crime 2021) and Sophie: A Murder in West Cork (Netflix 2021) and argues that they conferred documentary celebrity on their central figures, Sophie Toscan du Plantier and Ian Bailey. The celebritisation of these individuals as victim and villain, was achieved through the development of a convergent narrative across the three series, one salted with the plot twists, end-of-episode cliff hangers, emotional confrontations and supernatural speculation familiar to viewers of true crime, reality television and serial drama.Moreover, the gendered discourse deployed by these documentaries posthumously transformed Sophie Toscan du Plantier into a world-famous victim while providing an opportunity for Ian Bailey, who remains the prime suspect, to self-brand as a Gothic villain. Bailey’s 2022 announcement that he would launch a podcast and television series and his self-promotional activity on TikTok confirm the cultural capital associated with documentary celebrity, even, or especially, for the infamous.",drama narrative television_series plot_(graphics) art art_history suspect history media_studies literature visual_arts sociology,0,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

2,3,The Geri-Actions of the Aging Amitabh Bachchan,"Geri-action as a term within film studies describes a subgenre of action cinema in which, largely though not exclusively, men in their middle ages partake in narratives of action and spectacle, whilst simultaneously dealing with issues of aging bodies that participate in a move, or not as the case might be, towards some sort of an idea of retirement. This article explores how we might make the term work for us critically and discernibly in film, media, and cultural studies, especially in the non-Hollywood and global cinematic context. It uses the example of the Indian actor and star Amitabh Bachchan, aged 79, one of the country’s most iconic and longest serving entertainers in its cinema and related media industries. The case of Bachchan allows us to think about the notion of geri-action as not just a universal cinematic subcategory but one that we also have to make nuanced for local and global cultural contexts.",movie_theater action_(physics) hollywood spectacle context_(archaeology) narrative sociology aesthetics media_studies film_industry gender_studies art political_science visual_arts,2,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

3,4,Defining Maradonian studies,"The following is an excerpt from the volume Diego Maradona: A Socio-Cultural Study, edited by Pablo Brescia and Mariano Paz (London and New York: Routledge, 2023, 265 pp). This is the first book in English to explore the figure of Diego Maradona as an object of academic study, with the aim of introducing and theorising an emerging field that could be defined as ‘Maradonian studies.’ One of the most iconic football players of all time, Maradona is much more than a sporting legend. He has been read as an emancipatory political figure, a secular saint, a symbol of subalternity and, by others, an anti-hero (cheat, addict, opportunist). This paper includes extracts from the Introduction and Chapter 1 (co-written by Brescia and Paz), discussing the relevance of Maradona today, and his links to Argentinean politics and media. The volume contains individual chapters by different experts on a gamut of areas: Maradona as portrayed in the British press; Maradona and his links to Mexico, Spain, and Italy; the representation of Maradona in literature, cinema, music, and biography; Maradona approached from feminist perspectives; and the phenomenon of the Church of Maradona (among other topics).",legend symbol_(formal) politics hero representation_(politics) sociology media_studies object_(grammar) movie_theater art_history biography history humanities gender_studies art literature,0,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

4,5,"Save the world with Ben and Matt: Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and the importance of film texts to critical discussions of star campaigning","By looking at films such as Good Will Hunting and Argo, this paper provides close analysis of the on-screen roles of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, alongside a discussion of their involvement in social and political causes. Existing scholarship about Hollywood campaigning tends to gloss over the importance of films, viewing on-screen roles as secondary to a star’s off-screen activities. Instead, I argue that on-screen roles are directly relevant to any understanding of activist endeavour. Building on ideological critiques of celebrity humanitarianism, the goal is to show how films are crucial in shaping not just the media and institutional traction of Hollywood star campaigners, but also the wider instrumentalities that their campaigning performs. The paper concludes that close analysis of the on-screen roles of individuals like Affleck and Damon can help to reveal just how embedded the phenomenon of star campaigning is within neoliberal capitalism, as well as dominant discourses of race and gender. It can also uncover slippages in this phenomenon, whereby stars are able to mobilise their on-screen image to amplify attacks against the same hegemonic forces.",hollywood star_(game_theory) media_studies phenomenon scholarship ideology politics sociology aesthetics auteur_theory art movie_theater political_science art_history,0,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

5,6,"A star is made, not born: the production and reproduction of Mae West as a screen icon","Mae West was one of the biggest stars of early Hollywood, and her influence can still be felt in the work of many contemporary performers. While numerous scholarly accounts have examined West and her star persona, few have considered the creative practices and labour that went into the creation of that persona. This essay explores the construction of Mae West’s star persona by examining West’s strategic use of secondary and background characters in her films, along with advertisements, reviews, and other press coverage that accompanied the release of those films. I argue that Mae West, along with the studios that employed her and the press that covered her, shaped her particular star image in part by offering carefully crafted representations of imagined audiences. This example reveals broader institutionalised practices used by those in power in early Hollywood to influence how the public thought about stars during the studio era. My analysis includes films released between 1933 and 1940 with West in a starring role. The analysis also examines discourse surrounding West by way of promotional images, paid advertisements, articles, and reviews in periodicals such as Time, Motion Picture Herald, and The Educational Screen.",hollywood persona icon studio star_(game_theory) media_studies power_(physics) comics visual_arts art sociology advertising art_history literature,0,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

6,7,"Plotting the course: artistry, celebrity and kugak in South Korea","Within the context of the rising popularity of the Korean Wave, artists of Korean traditional music (kugak) often find themselves sidelined and struggling to gain the attention of the general population. In this article, I explore the strategies of three kugak artists who have risen to become not just stars in their field, but with a broader audience as well. Each artist highlights a different path to transcending subcultural kugak stardom: Pak Aeri’s appearance on reality TV; Kim Chunsu as a ‘kugak idol;’ and Yi Hŭimun’s eye-catching performance attire. In tracing the strategies each uses to balance popular fame and traditional artistry, I argue that although a ‘celebrity moment’ is crucial in order to attain popular stardom, sustained performance of ‘celebrity reluctance’ in engaging with popular culture remains a necessary strategy for retaining legitimacy as a traditional artist.",popularity legitimacy popular_culture visual_arts media_studies order_(exchange) context_(archaeology) sociology art balance_(ability) advertising population aesthetics psychology,0,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

7,8,‘They Are Not like […] Pamela Hódi […] Constantly Showing Off’—How Hungarian Tweens Negotiate Fame through Disney Princesses,"Ever since Disney Princesses were established as a marketing brand in 2000, they have become a famous ‘phenomenon’ that has been commercially successful, popular, and adored, but one that has also received much criticism from scholars and consumers alike. Although audience research has gained increasing recognition in recent years, this field’s attention has focused mainly on the ‘West’, neglecting Eastern European—including child—audiences. Moreover, while there are several scholarly examinations of Disney Princess films, these studies mainly employ textual analysis (Escalada-Cordova 2018; Whelan 2014; Wilde 2014) rather than conducting empirical research. Instead of reading for the audiences and making assumptions about how they interpret fame from a media text, in this case Disney Princesses, it is therefore crucial to ask audience members themselves, as Sonia Livingstone observes, ‘it is established that audiences are plural in their decodings, that their cultural context matters, and that they often disagree with textual analyses’ (2008, p. 4).By drawing upon diverse scholarly works within the field of celebrity studies as well as undertaking an audience study with Eastern European—specifically Hungarian—tweens, the objective of this article is twofold. On the one hand, this paper argues that animated characters are indeed entitled to have a fame status. It does so by deploying theorisations that distinguish between heroes and celebrities (North, Bland, and Ellis 2005), celebrities and stars (G. Turner, Bonner, and Marshall 2000), and differentiate among animated characters considered as ‘celeactors’ (Rojek 2001), or as stars (Ellis 2007; McGowan 2018; 2019). On the other hand, through the analysis of audiences’ diverse perceptions of fame, illustrated by Hungarian tweens’ understanding of Disney Princesses—an enormous global media phenomenon—this article provides a key case study for the aforementioned argument while highlighting the features of celebrity culture that are specific to Hungary. Taking into account Hungarian tweens’ approaches towards Disney Princesses, while considering that Disney is claimed to have ‘immense power over childhood culture’ (Garofalo 2013) and that ‘[t]he celebrity is simultaneously a construction of the dominant culture and a construction of the subordinate audiences of the culture’ (Marshall 2014, p. 48), this paper starts revealing the diverse ways in which different cultures conceptualise celebrity notions.",context_(archaeology) criticism media_studies negotiation phenomenon art reading_(process) sociology literature history,0,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

9,10,"Quiet celebrity in the time of pandemic: stripping away artifice in performances of self, cultures of citizenship, and community care","As the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly escalated in early 2020 and shelter-at-home orders cascaded around the world, celebrities streamed live performances from living rooms, home studios, and empty opera houses. Social media buzzed with gratitude for the entertainment, inspiration, and camaraderie that developed between ordinary citizens and celebrities sharing music from isolation via media technology. Celebrities also called upon their industry connections and friendships to create collaborative fundraising events, support working musicians whose tours were cancelled, and highlight amateur performers. Musicians who streamed simple performances from relatively modest homes and provided glimpses of their ‘real lives’ – their talents, personalities, homes, friendships, and families – won praise from audiences. Touring musicians and theatre performers in particular provide fascinating moments of empowered participatory citizenship during the pandemic. Beloved by relatively small, active fandoms but not widely popular outside their specific genres, these celebrities are positioned to provide meaningful social media connections with their devoted fans while not necessarily garnering high-profile media attention for their efforts. My critical analysis explores how musicians and theatre performers have responded to social distancing by sharing their music and fostering moments of connection with audiences who were seeking comfort during a global crisis.",entertainment media_studies studio amateur citizen_journalism sociology praise citizenship dance advertising visual_arts art psychology political_science,0,Citation Based,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.

1,2,Fans of Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.,"On April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in what was then the deadliest school shooting in American history. Despite causing a national panic and serving as a flash point for larger narratives on bullying, gun control, and media violence, both boys have gained active online fans. These fandoms dedicated to the Columbine shooters are widely referred to as dark examples of Internet communities, while the fans are also frequently denigrated as unstable and violent outcasts. Such dark online fandoms are yet to permeate mainstream culture or to challenge the preexisting perception of these communities as breeding grounds for the next wave of school shooters. While studies have covered the types of fans and their myriad interests, the field remains focused on more conventional examples of fan communities. In an effort to challenge and expand the object of focus when we study fandom, this qualitative study examines Columbine fans and their activity in order to understand the dominant motives they appear to have for engaging with and around such controversial figures and then concludes by exploring how this community might help us reflect more broadly on our concept of fandom. Redeeming these fans as part of diverse and complex communities of social relevance can demonstrate how even a dark fandom such as that of these Columbine shooters provides valuable cultural insights and benefits the field of fan studies.","['macabre, dark fandoms, Columbiners']",0,gpt 3.5 turbo abstract keywords,W2922594629,Dark Fandoms: An Introduction and Case Study.,"There is a deep and persistent cultural fascination with the macabre â€“ public executions, true crime books, slasher films, and sites of violence attract large audiences.
